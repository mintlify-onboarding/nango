</Info>

## Using Ramp with Nango[](#using-ramp-with-nango "Direct link to Using Ramp with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `ramp`  
Or, if you are connecting to the Sandbox/Demo system, use `ramp-sandbox`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Ramp in 5
minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

To register an OAuth app it seems you need a Ramp account. As a workaround you
can use the
[sandbox access form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddatpB56ClpJnrPdhgqApvxH%5FtQdeAcbEFqki-ftPMRrmX7g/viewform)
(link mentioned
[here](https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/overview/getting-started)) to get
in touch with the Ramp team and ask for a dev account.
