* [Google access token specs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/sts/rest/v1/TopLevel/token#response-body)
* [Google scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

* Google has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should work for most of them (e.g. GSheet, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.)
* You need to enable individual Google API on the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) before using them
* While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`http://localhost:8000` if you're doing the [Quickstart](/quickstart) locally)
