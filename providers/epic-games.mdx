Working with the Epic Games API?

Please add your learnings, favorite links and gotchas here by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs/docs/providers/epic-games.md).

## Using Epic Games with Nango[](#using-epic-games-with-nango "Direct link to Using Epic Games with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `epic-games`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Epic Games in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Register your app on the [Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal). It is all self-service, but far from self explanatory, you will need to set a client, link it with your app etc. There is also a branding review before you can distribute the app publicly.

## Useful links[](#useful-links "Direct link to Useful links")

* Nango implements the [Auth Web APIs mentioned here](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication) (specifically, it implements the `authorization code` flow).

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

* I could not find a public list of possible scopes, but there is a list when you setup your app in the dev portal.
* The refresh token has a very aggressive time out of just a few hours - make API requests very frequently (to refresh it) or you will lose access!
* Epic [returns many things](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication#requesting-an-access-token) (scroll down for an example) together with the access token. Use the `getRawTokenRepsonse` methods of the Nango SDK to access these. You can get even more additional information by [inspecting the access token](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication#account-information).
