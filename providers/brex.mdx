## Using Brex with Nango[](#using-brex-with-nango "Direct link to Using Brex with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `brex`  
For testing with Brex's staging system use `brex-staging` instead.  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Brex in 5
minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

You need to [register as Partner](https://www.brex.com/partners) with Brex to
get access to the OAuth API. We also recommend you join their developers Slack
community (see link below), where support is fastest.

  expire after 1h)
- Refresh tokens expire after 90 days of non use. Make sure you regularly make
  an API request as long as you need the connection.
- Brex offers a staging system to test your apps, you will get access when you
  register as a partner. Staging details are
