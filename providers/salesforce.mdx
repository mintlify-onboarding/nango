Working with the Salesforce API?

Please add your learnings, favorite links and gotchas here by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs/docs/providers/salesforce.md).

## Using Salesforce with Nango[](#using-salesforce-with-nango "Direct link to Using Salesforce with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `salesforce`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Salesforce in 5 minutes.

**Metadata captured by Nango**  
The `instance_url` is automatically stored in the [Connection Metadata](/reference/core-concepts#metadata) when it gets the access token.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Quick & easy for testing:

* Sign up for a Salesforce developer account.
* Login and in Setup create a new "Connected App" under `Apps -> App Manager`. Make sure you enable the OAuth section.

## Useful links[](#useful-links "Direct link to Useful links")

* [Salesforce OAuth documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess%5Fauthorization%5Fcode%5Fcredentials%5Fflow.htm&type=5) (Step 7 contains the details of what Salesforce returns along with the token)
* [Overview of OAuth scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected%5Fapp%5Fcreate%5Fapi%5Fintegration.htm&type=5)

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

* Salesforce calls the `client_id` and `client_secret` the `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`
* To enable offline data access with a refresh token, add the `refresh_token` (or its synonym, `offline_access`) scope. By default access tokens expire in \~2h (but customers can configure this value).
* If you encounter an error in your flow that says `invalid_client_id` [make sure your (developer) User's password does not contain any special characters](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000009ABLIA2) (yes, really.)
* Nango automatically stores the `instance_url` (e.g. `https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/`) in the [Connection metadata](/reference/core-concepts#metadata) for you. You can easily retrieve this with the [backend SDK](/reference/node-sdk#connectionDetails) or [Connections API](/reference/connections-api#connectionDetails)
