## Using Stack Exchange with Nango[](#using-stack-exchange-with-nango "Direct link to Using Stack Exchange with Nango")

Stack Exchange uses the same API for
[all its sites](https://stackexchange.com/sites) such as Stack Overflow, Server
Fault, Super User, Mathematics, Ask Ubuntu etc.

Provider template name in Nango: `stackexchange`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Stack
Exchange in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

You can [register your OAuth app here](http://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register)
(make sure you are logged into your Stack Exchange account).

There does not seem to be any approval process but once you are ready they can
[help you promote your OAuth app on StackApps!](https://stackapps.com/questions/7/how-to-list-your-application-on-stack-apps)

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

- By default access tokens expire (and cannot be refreshed). To get an access
  token that does not expire pass the `no_expiry` scope (along with your other
  scopes)
- Read the
  [usage notes here](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication#usage):
  You need to pass an additional `key` parameter together with your access token
  to benefit from higher API quotas.
