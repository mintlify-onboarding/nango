## Using Fitbit with Nango[](#using-fitbit-with-nango "Direct link to Using Fitbit with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `fitbit`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Fitbit in
5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Register your app [here](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new/). There does not seem
to be any approval process and you can immediately use your app.

## Useful links[](#useful-links "Direct link to Useful links")

- [Web/REST API docs](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/)
- [The full list of OAuth scopes](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/application-design/#Scopes)

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

- During the authorization flow, users need to manually select which scopes they
  grant to your application (from the ones you requested). They can complete the
  flow without granting all the requested scopes. The raw token response (which
  you can get from the Nango backend SDK) contains the `scope` key that lists
  the granted scopes.
