Provider template name in Nango: `box`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Box in 5
minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

**Rating: `Easy & fast`**Registering an app takes only a few minutes and you can
start building immediately. If you don't have one already, create a free
[Box account](https://box.com). Then go to the
[Box Developer console](https://app.box.com/developers/console) and create a new
OAuth 2.0 app.
