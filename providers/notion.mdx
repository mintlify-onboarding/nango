## Using Notion with Nango[](#using-notion-with-nango "Direct link to Using Notion with Nango")

Provider template name in Nango: `notion`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with Notion in
5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Register your app [here](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations)  
By default your app is internal only, once you created it you will be able to
make it public. There is no review process, unless you want to get listed in the
Notion App Gallery.

## API specific gotchas[](#api-specific-gotchas "Direct link to API specific gotchas")

- Notion does not let you pass OAuth scopes (called "capabilities" in the Notion
  API) with the authorization. Instead you set them when you register your OAuth
  app (called "integrations" in Notion). When you add a Notion config in Nango,
  just pass a single whitespace as scopes: `" "`
