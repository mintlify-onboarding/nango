## Using Google Calendar with Nango[](#using-google-calendar-with-nango "Direct link to Using Google Calendar with Nango")

Google Calendar uses the same OAuth mechanism as other Google services. Please
use the Google template for it in Nango: `google`  
Follow our [quickstart](/quickstart) to add an OAuth integration with the Google
Calendar API in 5 minutes.

## App registration & publishing[](#app-registration--publishing "Direct link to App registration & publishing")

Google's APIs all use the same OAuth service. To which APIs you get access is
determined by the scopes that you request.

Please check the main [Google OAuth API wiki](/providers/google) here for
details on how to register an OAuth app with Google.
