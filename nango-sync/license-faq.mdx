## License FAQ[](#license-faq "Direct link to License FAQ")

Nango is licensed under the [Elastic V2 license (ELv2)](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/main/LICENSE).

ELv2 is a simple, non-copyleft license, allowing for the right to “use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software”. Anyone can use Nango, free of charge. You can run the software at scale on your infrastructure. There are only three high-level limitations. You cannot:

* Provide the products to others as a managed service;
* Circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys; or
* Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices.

### What do you consider a managed service?[](#what-do-you-consider-a-managed-service "Direct link to What do you consider a managed service?")

Specific examples of what is allowed and prohibited:

* What is **allowed**: Your company, SaaS A, provides a cloud software for email marketing and uses Nango self-hosted to build integrations in their product. Nango syncs in their user's data from CRMs, e-commerce systems etc. This is allowed under the ELv2 as long as you do not circumvent any license key functionality mentioned above.
* What is **prohibited**: You start a "Mango cloud" service that offers Nango directly as a cloud service to other developers. This is prohibited under the ELv2 license.

If you are still unsure if your usage of Nango is allowed under the ELv2 please feel free to reach out to us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we are happy to help you out!

## Pricing[](#pricing "Direct link to Pricing")

A clear and transparent pricing is important to us.  
If this page does not answer your question please do not hesitate to ask us on our [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack). 

### Our monetization philosophy[](#our-monetization-philosophy "Direct link to Our monetization philosophy")

We believe Nango should be free to use for individuals, small teams and early stage startups: When you are just getting started and are looking for product-market fit the last thing we want you to worry about is your Nango bill. This will be reflected in the free tier of our self-service cloud offering as well as the features available in the free, self-hosted community edition.

Advanced features, which are required by larger organizations and those syncing a lot of data with Nango, will require a paid license that follows a usage based model. You will only pay for what you use and the pricing will scale with your usage. For these features both self-hosting and cloud will be available as deployment models and support by us is available.

### Current pricing[](#current-pricing "Direct link to Current pricing")

Whilst Nango Sync is in beta all features are free to self-host, and we expect the majority of them (if not all) to remain free once we move out of Beta. We are also happy to provide you with free support for your self-hosted instance at this point.

We currently offer cloud hosting on request and will be happy to work with you directly to find a pricing model that is fair for both sides. Depending on your needs we may even be able to offer you cloud hosting for free. Please reach out to us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) to discuss this and get setup with a cloud instance.
