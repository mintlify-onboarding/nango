## ⭐ Why Nango Sync?[](#-why-nango-sync "Direct link to ⭐ Why Nango Sync?")

Adding integrations to an app is complicated.

At first, it looks as simple as making requests to a 3rd-party API. But you
quickly need to build OAuth, background synchronisation, retries, pagination,
caching, webhooks, data transformation, monitoring, etc.

We pre-built these components so you don’t have to and can focus on shipping low
maintenance integrations fast.

## ✨ How it works[](#how-it-works "Direct link to ✨ How it works")

With Nango Sync, building integrations becomes as simple as:

1. Authenticate users with OAuth in your frontend:

```js
nango.auth("hubspot", "<user-id>"); // Starts OAuth flow
```

1. Easily sync data from any API endpoint to your DB in the backend:

```js
nango.sync("https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/contacts", config); // Syncs contacts forever!
```

1. Read the always-fresh data from the DB and use it in your app

```js
SELECT * FROM hubspot_contacts WHERE ...
```

Additionally, Nango Sync has out-of-the-box support for:

- 🔐 OAuth token retrieval & refresh
- 📶 Incremental syncs
- 🪝 Webhooks
- ⚡️ JSON-to-SQL schema mapping
- 🔄 Retries & rate-limit handling
- 🚀 Scalable & flexible open-source infrastructure
- ✅ Language-agnostic
- ☁️ Self-hosted and Cloud options

## 🧑‍💻 Example use cases[](#-example-use-cases "Direct link to 🧑‍💻 Example use cases")

Nango is API agnostic: It works with any API endpoint that returns JSON (you
just need to
[give it a few details](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs) about
the endpoint).

While Nango Sync supports millions of APIs, here are some of the most popular
ones:

- **CRMs** such as
  [HubSpot](/nango-sync/real-world-examples#hubspot-sync-all-hubspot-crm-contacts),
  Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, Zendesk Sell etc.
- **Accounting systems** such as Quickbooks, Xero, Netsuite, Zoho Books,
  Freshbooks etc.
- **Cloud providers** such as AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Fly.io, Heroku etc.
- **Productivity tools** such as Gmail, Google Calendar,
  [Slack](/nango-sync/real-world-examples#slack-sync-all-posts-from-a-slack-channel),
  Outlook 365, Zoom, Google Drive etc.
- **Project Management tools** such as Airtable, Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp etc.
- **Dev tools** such as
  [Github](/nango-sync/real-world-examples#github-sync-all-stargazers-from-a-repo),
  Gitlab, JIRA, Trello, Figma etc.
- ...any API endpoint that returns JSON

The docs have [more examples](/nango-sync/real-world-examples) of Nango Sync
configurations for different APIs and endpoints.
