title: "Manage Syncs"
---

Nango lets you adapt and control Syncs over time. 

Syncs can be managed with Nango's SDKs, REST API and soon an Admin Dashboard. 

Nango's SDKs and REST API let you embed managing capabilities in your product, so that your end users can perform actions such as: 

* Refresh a Sync
* Stop a Sync
* View when the next Sync job is due (or when the last on ran)
* View how many records were created/updated

### Pause a Sync[](#pause-a-sync "Direct link to Pause a Sync")

Pauses a Sync so no further sync jobs will run. You can reactivate the Sync with [Resume](#resume-a-sync).

* Node SDK
* REST API (curl)

```
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node-client'

nango.pause(123); // Param is the 'sync_id' returned upon Sync creation.

```

```
curl --request PUT \
--url http://localhost:3003/v1/syncs \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "action": "pause",
  "sync_id": 123
}'

```

### Resume a Sync[](#resume-a-sync "Direct link to Resume a Sync")

Resumes a Sync if it has been paused before: A first sync job will trigger immediately, afterwards your set frequency or cron schedule will continue as usual.

* Node SDK
* REST API (curl)

```
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node-client'

nango.resume(123); // Param is the 'sync_id' returned upon Sync creation.

```

```
curl --request PUT \
--url http://localhost:3003/v1/syncs \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "action": "resume",
  "sync_id": 123
}'

```

### Cancel a Sync[](#cancel-a-sync "Direct link to Cancel a Sync")

Permanently stops a Sync from running. Cancelled Syncs cannot be reactivated.

* Node SDK
* REST API (curl)

```
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node-client'

nango.cancel(123); // Param is the 'sync_id' returned upon Sync creation.

```

```
curl --request PUT \
--url http://localhost:3003/v1/syncs \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "action": "cancel",
  "sync_id": 123
}'

```

### Trigger a Sync job[](#trigger-a-sync-job "Direct link to Trigger a Sync job")

Manually trigger a Sync to run a sync job immediately. This is useful if you e.g. want to allow customers to trigger an immediate run in the UI. After the job runs the normal frequency or cron schedule will continue as usual.

* Node SDK
* REST API (curl)

```
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node-client'

nango.trigger(123); // Param is the 'sync_id' returned upon Sync creation.

```

```
curl --request PUT \
--url http://localhost:3003/v1/syncs \
--header "Content-type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "action": "trigger",
  "sync_id": 123
}'

```
