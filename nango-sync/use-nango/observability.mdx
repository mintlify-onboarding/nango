title: "Observability"
---

Observability is some of the most time-consuming infrastructure to set up when building external integrations in-house. To relieve engineering teams from this burden, Nango aims at providing powerful out-of-the-box tooling for observing interactions with external APIs.

While we will continue to make Nango more observable, there are already multiple ways that you can observe and debug Nango Syncs:

## Inspect Sync jobs in the DB[](#inspect-sync-jobs-in-the-db "Direct link to Inspect Sync jobs in the DB")

Sync jobs are the individual runs of Syncs. You can access all the information about Sync job execution in Nango's destination database, in the table `_nango_jobs` within the schema `nango`. 

Each jobs displays information about: 

* Start and end time
* Status
* Error message (in case of failure)
* Error stack trace (in case of failure)
* Added/updated/deleted/unchanged row counts (in case of success)
* Page count
* Attempts

## Inspect logs[](#inspect-logs "Direct link to Inspect logs")

When you run Nango locally with docker compose you can view the combined logs for all Nango containers, in real-time, with this command:

```
docker compose logs --follow

```

By default, Nango logs info-level messages and above. You can make logs more verbose by setting `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` (or less verbose by setting it to `error`) in the `.env` file.

## Temporal Admin Panel[](#temporal-admin-panel "Direct link to Temporal Admin Panel")

Additionally, as Nango uses [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) to orchestrates Sync jobs, you can further debug Sync job executions by logging to the Temporal admin panel. 

To enable the Temporal UI, you should run the `debug` Docker compose with the following command: 

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.debug.yaml up

```

You can now view, debug and control Temporal workflows (corresponding to Sync jobs) on the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8011.
