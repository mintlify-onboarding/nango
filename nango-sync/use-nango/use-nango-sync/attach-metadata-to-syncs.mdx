title: "Attach metadata to Syncs"
---

You can attach arbitrary metadata to each synced row using the `metadata` field in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/sync-all-options). 

This is useful if you want to query the synced data based on fields from your other SQL tables (e.g. `user_id`, `company_id`, etc.).
