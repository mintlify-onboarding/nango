## Sync Modes[](#sync-modes "Direct link to Sync Modes")

Nango supports the following syncing modes:

* **Full Refresh + Overwrite**: on each job, read all the objects from the API, overwrite by first deleting existing rows
* **Full Refresh + Upsert**: on each job, read all the objects from the API, append new rows & update existing rows (see below)
* **Incremental + Upsert** (coming soon): on each job, only read the new/updated objects from the API, append new rows & update existing rows

The **Full Refresh + Overwrite** mode is used by default. To use the **Full Refresh + Upsert** mode (recommended), provide a right value for the `unique_key` field in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/sync-all-options), the value of which will be used to dedupe rows.

## Deletion Modes[](#deletion-modes "Direct link to Deletion Modes")

Nango supports the following deletion modes: 

* **Hard Delete** (default): records to delete are removed from the database
* **Soft Delete**: records to delete are maintained in the db with a deletion date in the 'deleted\_at' column.

Specify the Deletion Mode using the `soft_delete` boolean field in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/sync-all-options).
