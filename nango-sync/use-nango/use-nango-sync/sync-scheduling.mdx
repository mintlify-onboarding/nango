### Cron-style scheduling[](#cron-style-scheduling "Direct link to Cron-style scheduling")

You can set Syncs to run at a fixed time by using the cron notation, with the
`cron` parameter in the
[Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs).

### Unaligned frequency

Alternatively, you can configure a Sync's frequency with the `frequency`
parameter in the
[Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/use-nango-sync/create-syncs). For a
full list of supported formats check the
[examples here](https://github.com/vercel/ms#readme).

<Tip>
  If no scheduling is specified for a Sync, it will run with a 1-hour frequency
  by default.
