### Cron-style scheduling[](#cron-style-scheduling "Direct link to Cron-style scheduling")

You can set Syncs to run at a fixed time by using the cron notation, with the `cron` parameter in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/sync-all-options).

### Unaligned frequency[](#unaligned-frequency "Direct link to Unaligned frequency")

Alternatively, you can configure a Sync's frequency with the `frequency` parameter in the [Sync config options](/nango-sync/use-nango/sync-all-options). For a full list of supported formats check the [examples here](https://github.com/vercel/ms#readme).

tip

If no scheduling is specified for a Sync, it will run with a 1-hour frequency by default.
