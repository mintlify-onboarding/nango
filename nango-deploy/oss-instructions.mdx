  "When self-hosting Nango, there is some configuration you need to take care
  of."
---

<Warning>
Nango is a recent product and we are improving it fast.

At this point you should expect frequent changes to Nango, some of them
requiring manual intervention upon updating your instance (i.e. breaking
changes). We will do our best to always document these changes and providing you
with a path to mitigate them. If you do not want to deal with this constraint,
we recommend that you use [Nango Cloud](/cloud).

If you need help or have questions about self-hosting please feel free to reach
out on our [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack).

</Warning>

## CLI[](#cli "Direct link to CLI")

Let the CLI know where to query Nango by adding the `NANGO_HOSTPORT` env
variable to your local environment (`.bashrc` or equivalent):

```js
export NANGO_HOSTPORT=<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>
```

## Server URL, Callback URL & Custom Domains[](#custom-urls "Direct link to Server URL, Callback URL & Custom Domains")

Add server environment variables for the instance URL and port (in the `.env`
file or directly on Heroku/Render):

```
NANGO_SERVER_URL=<INSTANCE-URL>
SERVER_PORT=<PORT>
```

The resulting callback URL for OAuth will be `<INSTANCE-URL>/oauth/callback`.

<Note>
  Your can customize the callback URL by adding a `NANGO_CALLBACK_URL`
  environment variable (in the `.env` file or directly on Heroku/Render).
</Note>

<Note>
  If your are using a custom domain, you should change the `NANGO_SERVER_URL`
  server environment variable accordingly (in the `.env` file or directly on
  Heroku/Render).
</Note>

## Persistent storage[](#persistent-storage "Direct link to Persistent storage")

If deploying with Docker Compose (e.g. AWS, GCP, DO), the database is bundled in
a docker container with transient storage. This means that updating the Docker
image causes configs/credentials loss. This is a no-go for production.

Connect Nango to an external Postgres DB that lives outside the docker setup to
mitigate this.

To do so, modify the default values of the following server env variables (in
the `.env` file):

```
NANGO_DB_USER=<REPLACE>
NANGO_DB_PASSWORD=<REPLACE>
NANGO_DB_HOST=<REPLACE>
NANGO_DB_PORT=<REPLACE>
NANGO_DB_NAME=<REPLACE>
NANGO_DB_SSL=true
```

<Tip>
Deploying with Render or Heroku automatically generates a persistent database
connected to your Nango instance.

For Render, the environment variables above are automatically set for you. For
Heroku, check out our Heroku docs page for specific instructions.

## Securing your instance[](#securing-your-instance "Direct link to Securing your instance")

### Securing the API[](#securing-the-api "Direct link to Securing the API")

You can secure your instance's API by adding the `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` env variable
(in the `.env` file or directly on Heroku/Render).

This will require
[Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Faccess%5Fauthentication) for
all sensitive API requests, e.g.:

```bash
curl '<INSTANCE-URL>/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<CONFIG-KEY>' -u '<SECRET-KEY>:'
```

<Warning>
Notice the `:` character appended after `<SECRET-KEY>`.
</Warning>

If you are using the Node SDK, when initializing the `Nango` object, pass in the
Secret key in the `secretKey` parameter.

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({
  host: "http://localhost:3003",
  secretKey: "<SECRET-KEY>",
});
```

You should also configure the CLI to authenticate with Nango. Add to your
`.bashrc` (or equivalent):

```js
export NANGO_SECRET_KEY=<SECRET-KEY>
```

<Tip>
  The Frontend SDK does not need the Secret key to initiate OAuth flows.
</Tip>

### Securing the dashboard[](#securing-the-dashboard "Direct link to Securing the dashboard")

By default, the dashboard of your Nango instance is open to anybody who has
access to your instance URL.

You can secure it with Basic Auth by setting the following environment variables
and restarting the server:

```bash
NANGO_DASHBOARD_USERNAME=<PICK-A-USERNAME>
NANGO_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=<PICK-A-PASSWORD>
```

### Encrypt sensitive data[](#encrypt-sensitive-data "Direct link to Encrypt sensitive data")

You can enforce encryption of sensitive data (tokens, secret key, app secret)
using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm. To do so, set the following environment
variable to a randomly generated 256-bit base64-encoded key:

```
NANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<ADD-BASE64-256BIT-KEY>
```

Once you restart the Nango server, the encryption of the database will happen
automatically. Please note that, at the current time, you cannot modify this
encryption key once you have set it.

## Telemetry[](#telemetry "Direct link to Telemetry")

We use telemetry to understand Nango's usage at a high-level and improve it over
time.

Telemetry on self-hosted instances is very light by default. We only track core
actions and do not track sensitive information.

You can disable telemetry by setting the env var `TELEMETRY=false` (in the
`.env` file or directly on Heroku/Render).
