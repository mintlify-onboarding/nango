It contains:

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes and can be deployed in 15:

- 1-liner to start a new OAuth flow in your frontend:

```js
let result = await nango.auth("github", "<user-id>");
```

- 1-liner to retrieve a fresh access token (with our SDK or REST API):

```js
let token = await nango.getToken("github", "<user-id>");
```

## üêª History[](#-history "Direct link to üêª History")

Pizzly was originally developed by the team at
[Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40+
individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer
maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted
the project and has since developed it together with the growing Nango
community.
