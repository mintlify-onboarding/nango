## Step 1: Get your Nango instance ready[](#step-1-get-your-nango-instance-ready "Direct link to Step 1: Get your Nango instance ready")

The easiest and fastest way to get a production ready Nango instance is with
Nango Cloud.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud">

Sign up for a Nango Cloud (no credit card required):  
[![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

After signing up, open the [dashboard](https://app.nango.dev/integrations).

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost">

You can try Nango on your local machine with docker compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango.git && cd nango
docker compose up # Keep the tab open
```

Once Nango is running locally, open the [dashboard](http://localhost:3003/) in
your browser.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">

You can self-host Nango on a single machine with our docker images. Check the
[Nango Self Hosted](/nango-deploy/oss-instructions) page for a list of all
providers, or use these 1-click deploy options:

[![Deploy to Render](/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango-render)

[![Deploy to heroku](/images/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango-heroku)

Once Nango is running on your instance, open the dashboard at
`https://<INSTANCE-URL>:3003`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Configure your API/Integration[](#step-2-configure-your-apiintegration "Direct link to Step 2: Configure your API/Integration")

Click the "Add New" button on the dashboard's `Integrations` page, it will ask
for you for 4 things:

1. Find your Provider/API in the dropdown.
2. Decide what this config should be called in Nango, we call this the
   `<CONFIG-KEY>` here and the UI calls it the "Unique Key". Most people pick
   the same name as the API, e.g. `github`.
3. Create an OAuth app on your Provider's developer portal. Obtain the client id
   & client secret (sometimes also called app id and app secret or similar) and
   add them.
4. You should also get a list of scopes you want to request. Prepare them in a
   comma separated list: `scope1,scope2,scope3` (no matter what the provider
   tells you, Nango will reformat them) and add them to the Scopes field.

Click "Save" and you are ready to trigger your first OAuth flow!

## Step 3: Trigger the OAuth flow from the frontend[](#step-3-trigger-the-oauth-flow-from-the-frontend "Direct link to Step 3: Trigger the OAuth flow from the frontend")

To trigger an OAuth flow in your frontend use our frontend SDK.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud">

You will need the `Public Key` from your
[Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) and the
`<CONFIG-KEY>` from the last step.

```js
import Nango from "https://unpkg.com/@nangohq/frontend/dist/index.js"; // For quick testing
// or
import Nango from "@nangohq/frontend"; // After installing the npm package

var nango = new Nango({ publicKey: "<PUBLIC-KEY>" });

// Trigger an OAuth flow
// Param 1: config key from Step 2 (bullet 4)
// Param 2: ID you will use to retrieve the connection (most often the user ID)
nango
  .auth("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>")
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(
      `OAuth flow succeeded for provider "${result.providerConfigKey}" and connection-id "${result.connectionId}"!`
    );
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(
      `There was an error in the OAuth flow for integration: ${error.message}`
    );
  });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost">

```js
import Nango from "https://unpkg.com/@nangohq/frontend/dist/index.js"; // For quick testing
// or
import Nango from "@nangohq/frontend"; // After installing the npm package

var nango = new Nango({ host: "http://localhost:3003" });

// Trigger an OAuth flow
// Param 1: config key from Step 2 (bullet 4)
// Param 2: ID you will use to retrieve the connection (most often the user ID)
nango
  .auth("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>")
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(
      `OAuth flow succeeded for provider "${result.providerConfigKey}" and connection-id "${result.connectionId}"!`
    );
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(
      `There was an error in the OAuth flow for integration: ${error.message}`
    );
  });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">

```js
import Nango from "https://unpkg.com/@nangohq/frontend/dist/index.js"; // For quick testing
// or
import Nango from "@nangohq/frontend"; // After installing the npm package

var nango = new Nango({ host: "<NANGO-HOST-AND-PORT>" });

// Trigger an OAuth flow
// Param 1: config key from Step 2 (bullet 4)
// Param 2: ID you will use to retrieve the connection (most often the user ID)
nango
  .auth("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>")
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(
      `OAuth flow succeeded for provider "${result.providerConfigKey}" and connection-id "${result.connectionId}"!`
    );
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(
      `There was an error in the OAuth flow for integration: ${error.message}`
    );
  });
```

If you are using server side rendering (SSR) with NextJS,
[use this workaround](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/335#issuecomment-1431757714).

With the frontend part ready, you should now be able to run a full OAuth flow
from your app while Nango will retrieve, store and refresh tokens automatically.

Go ahead & try it! ðŸ™Œ

## Step 4: Obtain the access token from the backend[](#step-4-obtain-the-access-token-from-the-backend "Direct link to Step 4: Obtain the access token from the backend")

There are a few different way in which you can obtain access tokens from Nango.
The dashboard is great for testing, but in your app we recommend using the
[node SDK](/reference/backend-sdk/nango-node-sdk) or the
[Connections REST API](/reference/backend-sdk/connections-api).

<Note>

**Make sure you always have a fresh access token**

Many OAuth providers provide short-lived access tokens (30-60 minutes). Nango
refreshes them automatically for you, but it is important that you always
request the access token right before each API call. Otherwise you may work with
a stale token that has been revoked and your API call will fail.

</Note>

### Dashboard[](#dashboard "Direct link to Dashboard")

Find the Connection in your dashboard's `Connections` page. Click "View" to see
the current access token and details.

### Backend SDK[](#backend-sdk "Direct link to Backend SDK")

If you work with Node, Nango offers a
[Node SDK](/reference/backend-sdk/nango-node-sdk) to retrieve tokens (more
languages coming).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud" >

You will need the `Secret Key` from your
[Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings).

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ secretKey: "<SECRET-KEY>" });

let accessToken = await nango.getToken("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>");
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost" >

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ host: "http://localhost:3003" });

let accessToken = await nango.getToken("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>");
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted" >

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ host: "<NANGO-HOST-AND-PORT>" });

let accessToken = await nango.getToken("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>");
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### REST API[](#rest-api "Direct link to REST API")

You can also use the Nango
[Connections REST API](/reference/backend-sdk/connections-api) to retrieve
connection details & the current access token:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud" >

You will need the `Secret Key` from your
[Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings).

```bash
curl 'https://api.nango.dev/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<CONFIG-KEY>'\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <SECRET-KEY>'
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost" >

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3003/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<CONFIG-KEY>'
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted" >

```bash
curl '<NANGO-HOST-AND-PORT>/connection/<CONNECTION-ID>?provider_config_key=<CONFIG-KEY>'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
