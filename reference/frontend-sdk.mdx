The Nango frontend SDK is
[available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nangohq/frontend) with the
package `@nangohq/frontend`.

## Instantiating the frontend SDK[](#instantiating-the-frontend-sdk "Direct link to Instantiating the frontend SDK")

Please refer to the
[quickstart](/quickstart#step-3-trigger-the-oauth-flow-from-the-frontend) for
how to instantiate the frontend SDK with your Nango setup.

## Triggering OAuth flows[](#triggering-oauth-flows "Direct link to Triggering OAuth flows")

You trigger OAuth flows with `nango.auth`. This function returns a promise,
which resolves if the OAuth flow was successful, and rejects if there was an
error.

```js
nango
  .auth("<CONFIG-KEY>", "<CONNECTION-ID>")
  .then((result) => {
    // result is an object with:
    // {
    //      providerConfigKey: '<CONFIG-KEY>',
    //      connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>
    // }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Error is an object with:
    // {
    //    error: {
    //      type: 'authorization_cancelled', (or similar)
    //      message: 'Authorization fail: The user has closed the authorization modal before the process was complete.'  (or similar)
    //    }
    // }
  });
```

There is an optional third parameter for this function, but it is currently only
used for the special case below.

## Triggering OAuth flows with configurations[](#connection-config "Direct link to Triggering OAuth flows with configurations")

Some API Providers require some connection-specific configuration (e.g. Zendesk,
Shopify).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is
specific to a user's Zendesk account:

```
https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new
```

To set the subdomain pass in an additional configuration object to
`nango.auth()`:

```js
nango.auth("zendesk", "<CONNECTION-ID>", {
  params: { subdomain: "<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>" },
});

// Or for Shopify
nango.auth("shopify", "<CONNECTION-ID>", {
  params: { subdomain: "<SHOPIFY-SUBDOMAIN>" },
});
```
