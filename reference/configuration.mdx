## Custom Callback URL[](#custom-callback-url "Direct link to Custom Callback URL")

<Note>
  When specifying the callback URL to the Provider, please copy/paste it
  exactly. Any difference (e.g. a trailing `/`) could cause the Provider to
  reject the OAuth requests.
</Note>

By default, Nango Cloud uses the following callback URL:
`https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback`.

Because most OAuth providers show the callback URL on the Authorization page to
the user, you may want to use a callback URL hosted on your own domain. For
instance: `https://my-awesome-app.com/oauth-callback`.

Nango Cloud lets you customize the callback URL on your
[Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings).

When using a custom callback URL you should redirect any request made to your
callback URL to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` AND pass along all
parameters exactly as you received them. The simplest way to do this is to use a
308 redirect.

<Warning>
Before changing the callback URL in Nango:

1. You should make sure that your redirect works
2. That your OAuth app, as registered with the provider, has the new callback
   URL whitelisted.

Otherwise the OAuth requests will fail or get rejected by the provider.

</Warning>

Nango Self-Hosted also supports
[custom callback URLs](/nango-deploy/oss-instructions#custom-urls).
