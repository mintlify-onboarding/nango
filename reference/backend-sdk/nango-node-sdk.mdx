title: "Nango Node SDK"
---

The Nango node SDK helps you retrieve access tokens and work with
[Connections](/reference/core-concepts#connections) from your backend.

## Installing & instantiating the node SDK[](#installing--instantiating-the-node-sdk "Direct link to Installing & instantiating the node SDK")

The node SDK is [available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nangohq/node)
as `@nangohq/node`, install it with your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm i -S @nangohq/node
```

How you instantiate the SDK depends on your Nango deployment method:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud" >

You will need the `Secret Key` from your
[Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings).

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ secretKey: "<SECRET-KEY>" });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost" >

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ host: "http://localhost:3003" });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted" >

```js
import { Nango } from "@nangohq/node";

let nango = new Nango({ host: "<NANGO-HOST-AND-PORT>" });
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are using TypeScript you will notice that the node SDK ships with
TypeScript types.

## Getting the current access token for a Connection[](#getting-the-current-access-token-for-a-connection "Direct link to Getting the current access token for a Connection")

```js
let access_token = await nango.getToken(
  "<PROVIDER-CONFIG-KEY>",
  "<CONNECTION-ID>"
);
console.log(access_token); // For OAuth 2 APIs this will print "axb_dijifoweif32qwij923jfo3" or similar
```

If you are not familiar with the Provider Config Key and Connection Id
parameters please take a look at the [Core Concepts](/reference/core-concepts)
page.

This is the recommended way to retrieve an access token to make an API call.

**Response for OAuth 1 tokens**  
If the access token stored in Nango is for an OAuth 1 provider (there are very
very few left, the most prominent ones are Twitter and Trello) the response is
an object instead of a string:

```js
{
    oAuthToken: "efjweiofoj34iji2io43j",
    oAuthTokenSecret: "dijdwojfwef89329834hf3ohf2o3i8"
}
```

This is because OAuth 1 requires you to cryptographically sign every HTTP
request, which requires both an access token and an (OAuth 1 specific) access
token secret.

<Tip>
**Keep your access tokens fresh and don't cache them!**

When you call this method the Nango server will check whether the access token
needs to be refreshed, and, if needed, refresh it before returning it to you.
This typically changes the access token.

Because of this it is important that you always use this method to get the
latest access token from Nango just before making an API request. If you cache
the access token on your end you risk working with an expired or revoked access
token and your API call will fail!

We take great care to make sure that this call to get an access token is
blazingly fast, so retrieving it fresh will not slow down your API requests.

## Getting Connection Details & Metadata[](#connectionDetails "Direct link to Getting Connection Details & Metadata")

```js
let connectionDetails = await nango.getConnection(
  "<CONFIG-KEY>",
  "<CONNECTION-ID>"
);
```

This retrieves the full Connection object from Nango, which looks like this:

```js
{
id: 18393,                                  // Nango internal connection id
created_at: '2023-03-08T09:43:03.725Z',     // Creation timestamp
updated_at: '2023-03-08T09:43:03.725Z',     // Last updated timestamp (e.g. last token refresh)
provider_config_key: 'github',              // <PROVIDER-CONFIG-KEY>
connection_id: '1',                         // <CONNECTION-ID>
credentials: {
    type: 'OAUTH2',                         // OAUTH2 or OAUTH1
    access_token: 'gho_tsXLG73f....',       // The current access token (refreshed if needed)
    refresh_token: 'gho_fjofu84u9....',     // Refresh token (if available, otherwise missing)
    expires_at: '2024-03-08T09:43:03.725Z', // Expiration date of access token (only if refresh token is present, otherwise missing)
    raw: {                                  // Raw token response from the OAuth provider: Contents vary!
        access_token: 'gho_tsXLG73f....',
        token_type: 'bearer',
        scope: 'public_repo,user'
    }
},
connection_config: {},                      // Additional configuration, see Frontend SDK reference
account_id: 0,                              // ID of your Nango account (Nango Cloud only)
metadata: {}                                // Structured metadata retrieved by Nango
}
```

The metadata field contains
[structured metadata](/reference/core-concepts#connection-metadata-and-raw-token-responses),
which Nango obtained from the OAuth flow. This varies by provider and is
documented on the provider's Nango documentation page.

## Accessing the raw token response[](#accessing-the-raw-token-response "Direct link to Accessing the raw token response")

```js
let rawTokenResponse = await nango.getRawTokenResponse(
  "<CONFIG-KEY>",
  "<CONNECTION-ID>"
);
```

A fast access method for obtaining the raw token response, as returned by the
OAuth provider, for a given connection. This is equivalent to getting the full
connection details and then reading `fullDetails.credentials.raw`.

## Getting a list of all Connections[](#getting-a-list-of-all-connections "Direct link to Getting a list of all Connections")

```js
let connectionsList = await nango.listConnections();
```

Returns a list of minimalistic Connection objects. This can be helpful if you
need to check whether a user has setup a specific integration. Note that the
list does not contain any access credentials and fetching it also does not
refresh the access tokens of any Connections.

The return value looks like this:

```js
{
  connections: [
    {
      connection_id: "<CONNECTION-ID-1>",
      provider: "<CONFIG-KEY-1>",
      created: "2023-03-08T09:43:03.725Z",
    },
    {
      //....
    },
    // Additional objects like the one above
  ];
}
```
