If you find a bug with one of the existing providers feel free to use these
steps to submit a PR with a fix. Thank you!

## Step 0: A quick overview of how provider templates work in Nango[](#step-0-a-quick-overview-of-how-provider-templates-work-in-nango "Direct link to Step 0: A quick overview of how provider templates work in Nango")

Support for the OAuth flow of different providers in Nango is implemented with
templates: A small config that tells Nango how to perform the OAuth flow for the
specific provider.

All templates of Nango live in a single file called
[providers.yaml](/providers/overview) in the `server` package.
[More about YAML here](https://yaml.org/).

Most templates only need to make use of 2-3 configuration keys, but in some
cases you might need more. For a full list of configuration options please check
the
[type definitions here](https://github.com/NangoHQ/Nango/blob/master/packages/auth/lib/models.ts).

The most commonly used configuration options are:

```yaml
provider-slug: # Shorthand for the provider, ideally the provider's name. Must be unique. Kebab case.
  ##########
  # Mandatory fields
  ##########
  auth_mode: OAUTH2 # Either OAUTH1 (for OAuth 1.0a) or OAUTH2
  authorization_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/authorize # The URL of the authorization page for the OAuth service (supports string interpolation)
  token_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/token # The URL for the token request (supports string interpolation)

  ##########
  # Optional fields
  ##########
  authorization_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the authorization step
    response_type: code
  token_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the token request
    mycoolparam: value
  refresh_url: https://api.example.com/oauth/refresh # The URL to use for refreshing the access token (only if different from token_url)
  scope_separator: "," # String to use to separate scopes. Defaults to ' ' (1 space) if not provided

  # Metadata capture
  redirect_uri_metadata:
    - subdomain # Save the 'subdomain' query parameter value returned in the Redirect URI (Connection Metadata)
  token_response_metadata:
    - scopes # Save the 'scopes' query parameter value returned in the token response (Connection Metadata)
```

<Note>
  Templates support parameters using string interpolation (cf. [flow
  Configuration](/reference/frontend-sdk#connection-config)) for dynamic URLs,
  etc.
</Note>

<Note>
  You can configure some [Connection
  Metadata](/reference/core-concepts#connection-metadata-and-raw-token-responses),
  which is additional metadata that you want to capture during the OAuth flow
  and store in the Connection.
</Note>

## Step 1: Add your new provider to `providers.yaml`[](#step-1-add-your-new-provider-to-providersyaml "Direct link to step-1-add-your-new-provider-to-providersyaml")

Fork the repo and edit the `packages/server/providers.yaml` file as explained
above to add support for the new provider. The API documentation should contain
all the details you need on the OAuth flow to complete this step.

[We are here](https://nango.dev/slack) if you need help with this.

## Step 2: Test your new provider[](#step-2-test-your-new-provider "Direct link to Step 2: Test your new provider")

<Tip>
Some OAuth providers are very restrictive with callback URIs and require https
or don't allow `localhost` as a domain/URL. This can make it very hard to test
things locally.

The easiest workaround we found is to use this simple service:
[https://redirectmeto.com](https://redirectmeto.com/).

With this the Nango localhost callback URL becomes
`https://redirectmeto.com/http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback` and you will
need to update the `NANGO_CALLBACK_URL` in the `.env` file:

```bash
NANGO_CALLBACK_URL=https://redirectmeto.com/http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback
```

</Tip>

To test your new provider:

The docker compose configuration in the root of the repo `docker-compose.yaml`
will run 2 containers.

1. Postgres DB
2. Nango Server

To propagate your changes after editing the `providers.yaml` file, run:

```bash
docker compose restart nango-server # Force a restart, which will load in the yaml again
docker compose run nango-server cat packages/server/providers.yaml # print the contents of the providers file from inside the container
```

When you are ready to test your new provider template:

### 1\. Add your client credentials to the local Nango Server[](#1-add-your-client-credentials-to-the-local-nango-server "Direct link to 1. Add your client credentials to the local Nango Server")

Open the [local dashboard](http://localhost:3003) in your browser and add a new
Integration with your freshly added provider (it should show up in the provider
dropdown).

### 2\. Trigger the OAuth Flow[](#2-trigger-the-oauth-flow "Direct link to 2. Trigger the OAuth Flow")

Run an OAuth flow on the
[local dashboard](http://localhost:3003/connection/create).

You can modify the ports in the docker compose if there are any conflicts with
other local services on your host machine.

### 3\. Check the access token in the dashboard[](#3-check-the-access-token-in-the-dashboard "Direct link to 3. Check the access token in the dashboard")

If all goes well you should see your new Connection in the
[Connections list](http://localhost:3003/connections) in the dashboard.

Check the Connection details and make sure all looks as expected (access token,
refresh token, metadata).

## Step 3: Add your integration to the Documentation[](#step-3-add-your-integration-to-the-documentation "Direct link to Step 3: Add your integration to the Documentation")

Add a file named `<provider_slug>.md` (e.g. `github.md`) corresponding to your
new integration to the `docs/docs/providers` folder. You can check out check out
[airtable](/providers/airtable) for an example.

Also, add your new documentation page to
[docs/sidebar.js](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/blob/master/docs/sidebars.js)
in the `items` array (in alphabetical order):

![Provider Sidebar List](/images/provider-sidebar-aee01a07f1d29f64c6ee2aa9cad69c53.png)

## Step 4: Add the integration logo (optional)[](#step-4-add-the-integration-logo-optional "Direct link to Step 4: Add the integration logo (optional)")

To be displayed in the app and docs, optionally add the provider logo in SVG to
`packages/webapp/public/images/template-logos/`. The name of the file should be
`<provider_slug>.svg`. Ideally, the logo should be 44px on its longest side
(width or height), inside a 62x62px transparent box.

## Step 5: Submit your PR[](#step-5-submit-your-pr "Direct link to Step 5: Submit your PR")

Submit your PR with the new provider to the Nango repo. Please thoroughly test
the integration and include the following mention in your PR: "I successfully
tested the provider config creation, OAuth flow & valid token."

We will review your PR asap and merge it into the main Nango repo for inclusion
with the next release.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!! ❤️

If you get stuck or need help please join our
[Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) where the Nango contributors hang
out. We will do our best to help you and get Nango to work with the OAuth flow
of your provider.
